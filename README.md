# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
This repository contains materials for the DS 340W Team Project at Pennsylvania State University.

## Introduction
This project is aimed at benchmarking the scores on sentiment analysis using the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. This would be done using natural language processing libraries and then associating a polarity with each word in the sentence to gain the overall polarity of the sentence which can then be used to calculate the sentiment of the sentence. 

The polarity can be broken down into 5 categories like negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive and positive. These can then be used to give the sentence an overall sentiment score.

## Problem Statement
The main problem in this project is to accurately predict the thoughts of the comment writers and then use NLP to correctly predict a sentiment score. This is a really interesting problem as we get to work on a real-life project which gives us some real-world experience working as a data scientist and what they would do in a day to day environment. This is also an interesting task as it involves the use of machine learning libraries, but that being said the task might not be so straightforward like there can be some major obstacles in our data wrangling process namely identifying sarcasm, negation, terseness and even language ambiguity. 

It's almost a relief that the entire dataset is in English because if it were to use any other language using the NLTK libraries would become extremely hard as they only have dictionaries that can output polarities of English words.

## Data
The datasets provided to us for this project include a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis.
